Package for Foundry Katana software.

Proof of concept on how to integrate the OpScript workflow in a 
version-controled pipeline. OpScript code should not live in the scene in a
studio environment, and should only import code stored in the pipeline arborescence.

This package offer tools and conventions to facilitate the integration of such workflow.

## Content

Most of the content is just linking dependencies and documenting how they
work together.

Future update on this package will be to add new custom nodes I created
in the [opscriptlibrary](opscriptlibrary/).


### lua

2 Low level lua package for OpScripts:

- [luakat](https://github.com/MrLixm/luakat) : api to interact more easily with Katana
- [luabased](https://github.com/MrLixm/luabased) : because everyone needs to extend the base lua 


### python

See the [katananodling](https://github.com/MrLixm/katananodling) package. It's a simple API to create
and register a custom type of node called "CustomNode".
We will use it to register a subclass of it called `OpScriptCustomNode`.

### library

Included as an example, but also for use, is my collection of existing OpScriptCustomNode
I made. Check the [opscriptlibrary](opscriptlibrary/) package.

_Only have Katana and all the packages visible in this directory as dependencies._
